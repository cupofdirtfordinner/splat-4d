i've realized recently that literally all of the lag is because of CSS redraws being slow. I was trying to figure out optimizations for a while, but it was futile.
my original suspect was the collision detection. and while that isn't the most optimized thing in the world, it turns out computers are really fucking good at
arithmaticand comparisons and shit (because it is doing thousands of them every second). I'm also pretty sure that a lot of the lag is because of the 3D CSS,
because it's fucking 3D, and I am using a chromebook with an intel celeron. Most of the lag is resolved when few objects are visible (thank god browsers seem to
do that automatically), or when performance mode is on. Performance mode still allows a 3D "camera", but it's still way better because all the other elements
are gone.
